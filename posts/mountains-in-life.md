The things worth doing in life are like mountains.

When you arrive at the bottom and look up, getting to the top seems impossible.

It may feel overwhelming at first, but you just have to start.

From then on, it’s an uphill battle, but you have to keep going.

You’ll inevitably face one obstacle after another that challenge you in different ways.

Although it may be uncomfortable, if you persevere through those moments where you really want to quit and turn around, you will eventually reach the top achieving far more than you thought possible.

So don’t ever hesitate to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of your comfort zone because the view from the peak is always worth it.

You never know where your next adventure could take you, so keep pushing yourself,

Always onwards.

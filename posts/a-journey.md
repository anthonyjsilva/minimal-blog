Life is like a journey.

One day you begin and one day you reach the end.

You have been through many things on this journey and will go through many more.

But what are you really doing with your life?

What get’s you up in the morning?

What is your purpose? Your reason for living?

Do you even care?

Are you just letting life pass you by?

When you reach the end and look back on your life what will you feel?

Fulfillment knowing that you lived your life with real purpose and meaning?

Or will you regret your journey?
